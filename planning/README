Planning

How to describe each language? How to get data?
  
for each language, have a markdown file with the 
name of the language as the title, followed by a 
description of the language and possibly grammar
and evaluation rules. 

How do we get the languages?

Eli's languages, Matthias' languages, Languages
from Shriram's books, Languages from  EOPL. Also
add BSL and ISL+ interpreters from HTDP. Add the
typed languages from TAPL, add the Tiger language.

Update:

I have bought the doman for $1 and hosted it on
a free hosting service A placeholder webpage will
be up on programming-langauge-playground.com after
the DNS propogation

Todos:

- Make async calls to server
- Make LHS of the webpage a different component,
  this area should automatically parse the markdown
  file associated with the chosen language
- Add the environments folder so that `ng serve` 
  runs
- Deploy the backend server (nithin)
- Deploy the website on after the server is
  deployed
